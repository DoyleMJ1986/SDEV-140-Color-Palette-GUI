This program contains a suite of actions to perform on colors generated by a set of sliders for red, blue and green colors, which include the following:
1.) Generation of codes for RGB (six digit hexadecimal value prefixed by a # with two digits representing each of red, blue and green color values in that order) HSV (a tuple of three values where H (Hue) is represented by a 
value in range of 0 to 360 and S (Saturation) and V (Value, also known as Brightness in some contexts) are each represented by a value of 0 to 100 as percentages), and CYMK (a tuple of four values, with the values being those for 
Cyan, Yellow, Magenta and Black and each value having a range of 0 to 100 as percentages. In the case where Black has a value of 100, all other colors have a value of 0) respectively
2.) Buttons to copy the codes to the system clipboard for use in other applications
3.) Buttons to invert the colors, based on each of the color palette systems (RGB, HSV and CYMK respectively).
